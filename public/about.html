<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Johnathon, and I am beginning my journey as a web developer. Back
  in the 90s as a young lad, I enjoyed making image gallery websites featuring
  characters from Dragonball Z, my favorite TV show at the time. As you can tell
  by this website, I have nowhere to go but up!
</p>

<p>Here's one of my favorite psalms in the Bible:</p>
<h2>Psalm 23</h2>
<p>
  The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br />
  He makes me lie down in green pastures.<br />
  He leads me beside still waters.<br />
  He restores my soul.<br />
  He leads me in paths of righteousness<br />
  for his name's sake.<br />
  <br />
  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br />
  I will fear no evil,<br />
  for you are with me;<br />
  your rod and your staff,<br />
  they comfort me.<br />
  <br />
  You prepare a table before me<br />
  in the presence of my enemies;<br />
  you anoint my head with oil;<br />
  my cup overflows.<br />
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me<br />
  all the days of my life,<br />
  and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord<br />
  forever.<br />
</p>
